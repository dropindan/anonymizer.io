Anonymizer.io - faceless within seconds
===================================

[Anonymizer.io](http://anonymizer.io/) is a tool to pixelate faces. You can upload your own photos and play with six different levels of pixelation.  
For the face detection I use the great face detection plugin of Jay Salvat (https://github.com/jaysalvat/jquery.facedetection).
